Test 2: timing getAllValidWords() for 5.0 seconds using dictionary-yawl.txt
        (must be <= 2x reference solution)
    - reference solution calls per second: 6759.83
    - student   solution calls per second: 10778.87
    - reference / student ratio:           0.63

=> passed    student <= 10000x reference
=> passed    student <=    25x reference
=> passed    student <=    10x reference
=> passed    student <=     5x reference
